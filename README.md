# microbELP 
**MicrobELP** is a dictionary-based pipeline using the NCBI taxonomy to automatically label entities in BioC-formatted JSON files (from [Auto-CORPus](https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus)) as microbial entities, their taxonomic identifiers and taxonomic rank.


## Installation
MicrobELP has a number of dependencies on other Python packages, it is recommended to install it in an isolated environment.

`git clone https://github.com/omicsNLP/microbELP.git`

`pip install ./MicrobELP`
